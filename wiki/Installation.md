## Obtaining the Media Access Key (MAK)

The Media Access Key is a special key that is unique to your TiVo account. It enables you to move the shows from your TiVo for any reason, including TivoToGo. It is needed by cTiVo to download shows.

1. [Sign in to your TiVo account](http://www.tivo.com/tivo-mma/index.do)
1. Go to [TiVo's Key page](http://www.tivo.com/tivo-mma/showmakey.do)
1. Copy down the ten-digit number. That is your MAK
Alternatively, you can simply use your TiVo, and do the following:
1. Go to the main TiVo menu
1. Go to Messages and Settings
1. Go to Account and System Info
1. Go to Media Access Key
1. Copy down the 10-digit number

If using Avast, you currently need to disable Web Shield for cTivo to work.
